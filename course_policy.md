### Late Days

You have a total of 6 late days to use during the semester. This covers all possible circumstances of unanticipated delays, including illness, unexpected travel, or emergency. If you need an exception for this, you must arrange via DSP. Otherwise, additional late days are not allowed for any circumstances.

You may not use more than 2 late days per assignment. Gradescope will be closed after 48 hours (if it happens to remain open after that, you can still submit). Once Gradescope closes, any missing submission will receive zero. Only the latest submission will be graded if you submit multiple times.

We do not keep track of partial late days. One late day is spent per 24 hour window after the deadline, including if a submission occurs within (including at the very beginning of) a window. 

You must keep track of your use of late days separately from us so you are aware of your usage.

### Prerequisite
- PhD students: There are no formal prerequisites, but students are generally expected to be familiar with neural networks, deep learning, Pytorch, and Numpy.
- Undergraduate and master students: CS 182, 188, 189, or 183/283A are strongly encouraged. This will be reviewed in the enrollment form.

### In person attendance
Lectures will be live and in-person. All lectures will be recorded and made available to enrolled students and Cal-affiliated auditors.  However, we do not provide guarantees on how quickly these recordings & lecture slides will be made available online. Recordings are intended primarily for later reference only and not as a replacement for attending lecture. Thus, we strongly encourage in-person attendance, although we will not take attendance.

In-person attendance is required for the project presentations in Class 27 and 28, except where otherwise arranged via DSP.

### Disability Support Services

If you need disability-related accommodations in this class contact the UC Berkeley Disabled Students Program ((510) 642-0518 / [website](http://dsp.berkeley.edu)). DSP services include accommodation letters, assistive technology and access services. An accommodation letter is needed in order for the instructor to grant an accommodation (e.g. extended exam time). Students must be assessed every semester to receive an accommodation letter. 

### Policy for using generative AI
You may use generative AI tools such as Co-Pilot and ChatGPT to assist you with your work, including for code and writing suggestions. However, your final submission will be evaluated based on your own voice and ideas. What matters most are your insights, reasoning, and takeaways.
- Aspects of writing that will be evaluated: Clarify and substance of ideas, avoiding repetition or unnecessary verbosity, saying something meaningful rather than using many words to say little.
- Aspects of writing that won’t be evaluated: Perfect grammar, formal tone, use of “educated” or sophisticated vocabulary.

### Laptop policy
Please feel free to bring and use your laptops / other electronics to class if it is related to the lecture, e.g., for note-taking. We discourage students from using the laptop for non-class related things.
